    <h2>How to Make Perfect Poached Eggs</h2>
    <p>A poached egg is an egg that has been cooked, outside the shell, by poaching, as opposed to simmering or boiling.</p>
    <p>This method of preparation can yield more delicately cooked eggs than cooking at higher temperatures such as with boiling water.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 egg</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring a pot of water to a gentle boil, then salt the water. Meanwhile, crack an egg (or 2, or 3!) into a small cup.</li>
        <li>With a spoon, begin stirring the boiling water in a large, circular motion.</li>
        <li>When the water is swirling like a tornado, add the eggs. The swirling water will help the egg white wrap around itself as it cooks.</li>
        <li>Cook for about 2 1/2 to 3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Using a slotted spoon, remove the egg (or eggs) to a plate.</li>
    </ol>
